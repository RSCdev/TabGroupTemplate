TabGroupTemplate for Appcelerator Titanium
==========================================

This is a basic App Template for Titanium Mobile projects. Includes a tabGroup with 3 tabs and 3 windows using CommonJS modules. 

Is based on CommonJS modules and saves a lot of time creating the initial boilerplate project structure.

All module paths should be declared in ModulePaths.js, so all module paths are isolated from code.

Works in android, iOS and mobile web.

Created with Titanium sdk 2.1
